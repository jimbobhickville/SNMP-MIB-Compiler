    DESCRIPTION
        "This module defines objects that are used to test
        high capacity counters. This consists of objects to set
        the 'initial value' of counters, set the time period
        of counter value change, and to set the size of the
        counter increment. Each high capacity counter is
        implemented as a pair of 32-bit counters and a 64-bit
        counter. And additionally, there is an ASCII and
        Opaque representation of each 64-bit counter.
        
        Please note that the 64-bit counters are not accessible
        by SNMPv1 operations, and multi-lingual agents must
        treat objects with data type of 'Counter64' as not
        existing. The behavior of such agents is described
        in detain in RFC 2089, 'V2ToV1 Mapping SNMPv2 onto
        SNMPv1 within a bi-lingual SNMP agent'."

        incremented each time period. The 'initial' value
        is '40000001'h, which will cause a 32-bit counter
